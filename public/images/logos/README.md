# Logo Files

Please place your Toupto logo files in this directory.

## Required Files

- `toupto-logo.png` - Main logo (recommended: 240x80px or higher resolution)
- `toupto-logo.svg` - Vector version (optional, preferred for scalability)

## Logo Specifications

The Logo component expects the file to be named:
- `toupto-logo.png` or
- `toupto-logo.svg`

The logo should include both the gradient section and the blue rectangle as shown in your brand guidelines.

## Usage

The logo is automatically used in:
- Header/Navigation (dark variant)
- Footer (light variant)
- Can be used anywhere by importing the Logo component

If you need to adjust the logo size or styling, edit `components/layout/Logo.tsx`
